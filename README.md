# Email-Spam-Detection
Used Multinomial Naive Bayes to filter the spam Messages with training a sample dataset. I have used sklearn CountVectorizer to convert message into Vector arrays and then implementing the Model.
Also I Have implemented the same together using Sklearn Pipeline, which is a lot convinient.
